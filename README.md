# Etch a sketch \(ಥ \_ ಥ\)

This project was a challenge for me, I used everything I knew and I had to review old projects, </br>
classes and it took me 2 days more than I had planned.

Acquired knowledge:
● More event types.
● Better understanding of loops.
● Different uses of EventListeners and Loops.
● Uses of variables in CSS.
● How to style different inputs.
